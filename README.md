# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains multiple notebooks focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, aimed at discovering patterns, identifying relationships, and summarizing key insights from datasets.

## Overview
- This project demonstrates different techniques and methodologies for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- Contains **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses** to explore both individual features and feature relationships.
- Uses libraries like **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**, and **pandas-profiling** to generate visualizations and insights.
- Helps users frame the right questions to ask from data for meaningful exploration and analysis.
- Automates part of the EDA process using **pandas-profiling** to generate detailed reports.
